Instructions
------------

Please refer to https://github.com/bechtoldt/formula-docs to learn how to use
this formula, how it is built and how you can add your changes.

**NOTICE:** This formula uses the formhelper module which is a very useful Salt execution module that isn't available
in upstream yet. Please consider retrieving it manually from https://github.com/bechtoldt/salt-modules and
make it available to your Salt installation. Read `SaltStack documentation <http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/#modules-are-easy-to-write>`_ to
see how this can be achieved.

Take a look at older `releases <https://github.com/bechtoldt/saltstack-foreman-formula/releases>`_ to get a version that isn't using the formhelper
yet (if any).


Compatibility
-------------

See <TODO> file to see which Salt versions and operating systems are supported.


Dependencies
------------

None


Contributing
------------

  formula-docs (dependency), show up alternative?
* table/ matrix: os/salt compatibility (dedicated file)
* add list of available states

* do initial Foreman setup (domains, proxies, OSs, etc.) with hammer CLI (WIP)
* show full example/ demonstration/ screencast of how to use this and other formulas
* plugins require internet access, configure http(s) proxy env var?
